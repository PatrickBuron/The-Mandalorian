            <h2>New Technology</h2>

            <p>
                For The Lion King, the results of the virtual photography were then rendered by MPC as the final animation for the film.[3] 
                On The Mandalorian, Favreau wanted to use virtual technology to aid live-action photography and also develop the video wall 
                system.[3][70] ILM partnered with video game developer Epic Games to create a new system named StageCraft based on Epic's 
                game engine Unreal Engine. StageCraft consists of large LED video screens on which digital environments can be rendered in 
                real-time for actors to perform in front of.
            </p>
                <br>
           <p> During pre-production, the virtual photography process developed for The Lion King was used to plan the series' filming and determine what 
                environments would be needed on set. The digital environments were then created by ILM and added to StageCraft ready for live-action 
                photography with the actors. Some of these environments were based on location photography in countries such as Iceland and Chile, on which 
                Favreau said, "The actors aren't brought on location. The location is brought to the actors."[3] The environments were designed by the series' 
                visual art department, led by Lucasfilm's creative director Doug Chiang and production designer Andrew L. Jones.[72] During filming, the 
                digital environments were rendered on a video wall in real-time, allowing the filmmakers and actors to see the environments.[71] ILM used 
                a smaller version of the technology for Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018), but on The Mandalorian they utilized a 21-foot-tall (6.4 m) set 
                that was 75 feet (23 m) in diameter, surrounded by a 360-degree semicircular LED video wall and ceiling. 
            </p>

               <p> The Manhattan Beach Studios set is referred to as a "volume", which is traditionally the name for motion capture stages. Favreau's initial intention was to use the 
                video wall as a way to provide realistic interactive lighting for the actors, with a section of the screen behind the actors displaying a 
                green screen so a higher quality version of the background could be added in post-production. During filming tests with the technology, 
                the team realized that the Unreal Engine could render visuals fast enough that they could have the background move with the camera. This 
                allowed the system to maintain the appearance of parallax, where the environment would appear differently based on the angle it was being 
                looked at just as a real 3D environment would. This effect causes some distortion to the image on the video wall but looks like a real 
                environment when viewed through the camera.[70] The images rendered on the video wall in real-time were often of a high enough quality to 
                be used as final effects when filmed on set.
            </p>
                <br>
               <p> Physical elements were added to the volume to match the digital backgrounds, such as dirt on the floor to match the dirt displayed on the 
                video wall.[70] Interior spaces were also created, such as an office used by Imperial agents where the walls and ceiling were displayed on 
                the video wall around a physical table.[71] The production had several physical sections of the Razor Crest, the Mandalorian's ship, that 
                could be placed within the volume, such as having the front half of the ship physically built and the back half rendered digitally.[70][71]
                 The environments could be manipulated in StageCraft on set as required, allowing the filmmakers to request changes to the environment and 
                have them rendered on the video wall on the same day.[71] The production was able to change between environments within half an hour, or even 
                faster if the physical elements within the volume were not visible and did not need to be changed.[70] One of the primary advantages of using 
                video wall technology was the realistic lighting, with the wall providing ambient light and accurate reflections on the actors. This was 
                especially important for the Mandalorian, who wears reflective armor. 
            </p>
                <br>
                
            <p>Traditionally, on production using a green screen, the visual effects team would have to remove the green reflections from a reflective character or object in post-production, and then add new reflections that 
                matched the digital environment. Using StageCraft, the reflections in the Mandalorian's armor were already correct on set. It also allowed 
                for the series' cinematographers to light scenes in a way that would match the background, rather than lighting the set and hoping the 
                digital background would match in post-production as they would have to do with the green screen. A technique used by the production to 
                ensure the lighting from the video wall looked natural was to have the actors in shadow, with light from the environment behind them, 
                often creating silhouettes.[70]
