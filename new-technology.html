            <h2>New Technology</h2>

            <p>
                For The Lion King, the results of the virtual photography were then rendered by MPC as the final
                animation
                for the film.
                On The Mandalorian, Favreau wanted to use virtual technology to aid live-action photography and also
                develop
                the video wall
                system. ILM partnered with video game developer Epic Games to create a new system named StageCraft based
                on
                Epic's
                game engine Unreal Engine. StageCraft consists of large LED video screens on which digital environments
                can
                be rendered in
                real-time for actors to perform in front of.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> During pre-production, the virtual photography process developed for The Lion King was used to plan the
                series' filming and determine what
                environments would be needed on set. The digital environments were then created by ILM and added to
                StageCraft ready for live-action
                photography with the actors. Some of these environments were based on location photography in countries
                such
                as Iceland and Chile, on which
                Favreau said, "The actors aren't brought on location. The location is brought to the actors." The
                environments were designed by the series'
                visual art department, led by Lucasfilm's creative director Doug Chiang and production designer Andrew
                L.
                Jones. During filming, the
                digital environments were rendered on a video wall in real-time, allowing the filmmakers and actors to
                see
                the environments. ILM used
                a smaller version of the technology for Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018), but on The Mandalorian they
                utilized
                a 21-foot-tall (6.4 m) set
                that was 75 feet (23 m) in diameter, surrounded by a 360-degree semicircular LED video wall and ceiling.

            <p> The Manhattan Beach Studios set is referred to as a "volume", which is traditionally the name for motion
                capture stages. Favreau's initial intention was to use the
                video wall as a way to provide realistic interactive lighting for the actors, with a section of the
                screen
                behind the actors displaying a
                green screen so a higher quality version of the background could be added in post-production. During
                filming
                tests with the technology,
                the team realized that the Unreal Engine could render visuals fast enough that they could have the
                background move with the camera. This
                allowed the system to maintain the appearance of parallax, where the environment would appear
                differently
                based on the angle it was being
                looked at just as a real 3D environment would. This effect causes some distortion to the image on the
                video
                wall but looks like a real
                environment when viewed through the camera.[70] The images rendered on the video wall in real-time were
                often of a high enough quality to
                be used as final effects when filmed on set.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> Physical elements were added to the volume to match the digital backgrounds, such as dirt on the floor
                to
                match the dirt displayed on the
                video wall. Interior spaces were also created, such as an office used by Imperial agents where the
                walls
                and ceiling were displayed on
                the video wall around a physical table. The production had several physical sections of the Razor
                Crest,
                the Mandalorian's ship, that
                could be placed within the volume, such as having the front half of the ship physically built and the
                back
                half rendered digitally.
                The environments could be manipulated in StageCraft on set as required, allowing the filmmakers to
                request
                changes to the environment and
                have them rendered on the video wall on the same day. The production was able to change between
                environments within half an hour, or even
                faster if the physical elements within the volume were not visible and did not need to be changed.
                One
                of the primary advantages of using
                video wall technology was the realistic lighting, with the wall providing ambient light and accurate
                reflections on the actors. This was
                especially important for the Mandalorian, who wears reflective armor.
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>Traditionally, on production using a green screen, the visual effects team would have to remove the green
                reflections from a reflective character or object in post-production, and then add new reflections that
                matched the digital environment. Using StageCraft, the reflections in the Mandalorian's armor were
                already
                correct on set. It also allowed
                for the series' cinematographers to light scenes in a way that would match the background, rather than
                lighting the set and hoping the
                digital background would match in post-production as they would have to do with the green screen. A
                technique used by the production to
                ensure the lighting from the video wall looked natural was to have the actors in shadow, with light from
                the
                environment behind them,
                often creating silhouettes.
