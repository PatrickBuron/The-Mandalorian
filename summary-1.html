            <h2>Season 1 Summary</h2>
            <p>The fob leads Mando to Arvala-7, where he meets the wise Ugnaught Kuiil. Kuiil teaches Mando how to ride
                a
                blurrg so he can reach
                the location of the bounty safely. Upon reaching the location of the bounty, Mando comes into contact
                with
                fellow bounty hunter
                IG-11. Forced into an alliance, they fight off stiff resistance at the site. Once the coast is clear,
                Mando
                and IG-11 search
                the building for the target. They come across a pram; Mando opens it to find a small, green child with
                large
                ears. IG-11 tries
                to shoot the Child, but Mando shoots first.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> Mando escorts the Child back to the landing site of the Razor Crest, encountering even more bounty
                hunters.
                They find just the
                skeleton of the Crest remaining after having been scavenged by Jawas. Kuiil mediates a trade between
                Mando
                and the Jawas: if
                Mando can bring them a Mudhorn egg (sooga!), then they will return the parts to the Crest. Mando and the
                Child encounter the
                Mudhorn, who is protective over the egg to say the least.
                Mando, injured and almost killed, is saved by the Child when he uses the Force to hold the Mudhorn in
                the
                air and away
                from Mando. The Child, sleepy from his efforts, and Mando, injured and muddy from his encounter, return
                to
                the Jawa’s
                sandcrawler with the egg. Reunited with his ship’s parts, Mando and Kuiil reconstruct the Razor Crest.
                With
                his ship back
                in functioning order, Mando and the Child lift off for Nevarro.

            </div>

            <p> Back at the Client’s compound, Mando redeems the bounty for a massive amount of beskar. Leaving the
                Child
                with Doctor Pershing,
                Mando heads for the Mandalorian covert in the Nevarro sewers. There, he gives his beskar to the Armorer,
                who
                forges it into a
                brand new set of armor to replace his damaged set, as well as whistling birds, which is a specialized
                weapon
                that is scarce but
                can down multiple enemies at a time with ease. Mando then reunites with Karga at the cantina for his
                next
                assignment, but his
                mind remains on the Child. So, he returns to the compound, infiltrates the area by taking out several
                stormtroopers, and
                threatens Doctor Pershing until he hands over the Child.
                Cornered, Mando is forced to use the whistling birds on the surrounding troopers. Not out of the woods
                yet,
                bounty hunters
                flock to the streets to stop Mando from leaving with the Child. Suddenly, several Mandalorians from the
                covert arrive to
                hold the bounty hunters back while Mando and the Child make their escape. Karga follows him onto the
                Razor
                Crest, where Mando
                is forced to shoot him to escape. Mando and the Child quickly take off to put distance between
                themselves
                and the threats.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> With a large target on his back, Mando lands on the remote planet of Sorgan. There, he finds a common
                house
                with food for the
                Child. While the Child eats, Mando investigates the area and is taken out by Cara Dune, a former Rebel
                shock
                trooper. Not
                wanting to step on her toes, Mando and the Child return to the Razor Crest. There, a pair of locals
                approach
                him to ask for
                assistance in protecting their krill farming village from raiders. Mando pays Dune for her assistance.
                There, he meets Omera,
                to whom he admits that he’s not taken off his helmet in front of others since he was a child.
                Mando and Dune discover that the raiders travel in an AT-ST walker, and because of that, they try to
                convince the villagers
                to abandon their homes and start anew. But, the villagers insist on staying, so Mando and Dune train
                them to
                fight. They
                devise and perfectly execute their plan: the villagers and Dune lure the AT-ST to step down into a krill
                pond, and Mando
                charges it with a grenade to blow it up. Victorious, they remain in the village for a period of time.
                Mando
                contemplates
                leaving the Child at the village, but then he hears blaster fire. Cara Dune had shot a bounty hunter
                with a
                tracking fob
                leading directly to the Child. No longer safe, Mando and the Child depart the village.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> Mando’s next destination is Tatooine, where he docks the Crest in Mos Eisley. Peli Motto, the attendant
                at
                the hangar, promises
                to watch over the ship while Mando is gone. She hears a noise coming from the ship, and there she finds
                the
                Child. She promises
                to watch over him, calling him “Bright Eyes.” Meanwhile, Mando enters a very familiar cantina in a very
                familiar booth to meet
                a young man named Toro Calican, who is seeking tutelage on bounty hunting. Their target? Sharpshooter
                assassin Fennec Shand.
                The pair head out into the Dune Sea on speeders, using flash grenades to blind Shand. This stifles her
                accuracy to the point
                where she doesn’t kill them, but she does force Mando’s speeder to crash.
                Calican and Mando still manage to capture her, but Mando has to double back to get another form of
                transport. Shand informs
                Calican of the hefty bounty on Mando’s head to try to convince him to release her. But, Calican shoots
                her
                in the abdomen
                instead and heads back to Mando’s hanger. Taking Motto hostage and holding the Child in his arms, he
                greets
                Mando when he
                returns. After a brief standoff, Mando shoots Calican and leaves with the Child in the Crest.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> Landing on an unknown space station, Mando greets an old acquaintance named Ranzar Malk, who has a job
                for
                him. Malk introduces
                Mando to his crew for the job: Migs Mayfeld, former Imperial sharpshooter; Burg, an intimidating
                Devaronian;
                Zero, the droid
                whose official designation is Q9-0; and Xi’an, a flirtatious Twi’lek. They board a New Republic
                Correctional
                Transport, and
                Mando leads the group to the control center whilst taking down several sentry droids. They intimidate
                the
                only living crew
                member on board for the cell number of their target. Approaching the cell, they rescue a Twi’lek named
                Qin,
                the brother of
                Xi’an.
                Then, the mercenaries lock Mando in the once occupied cell. Mando escapes and encounters the
                mercenaries,
                locking up Xi’an,
                Burg, and Mayfeld in a cell. He shoots Zero when he gets back on board the Razor Crest but spares Qin so
                he
                can collect the
                full cut. Returning to the space station, Ranzar Malk orders Qin to kill Mando, but Mando puts a tracker
                on
                Qin. Three
                New Republic X-wings show up and shoot down Malk’s escape ship and fire on the space station. Mando and
                the
                Child make a
                clean getaway.
            </p>

            </div>

            <p>While aboard the Razor Crest, Mando gets a holo from Greef Karga on Nevarro. He speaks of horrible
                conditions
                in the city
                because of the Client, and since he and Mando now have a mutual enemy, he suggests they team up to kill
                the
                Client. If their
                plan works, Mando keeps the Child, and Karga’s city will be returned and his reputation restored. First,
                Mando needs a crew.
                He returns to Sorgan to recruit Cara Dune and also returns to Arvala-7 to recruit Kuiil to watch the
                Child.
                Whilst discussing
                the situation with Kuiil, IG-11 appears, serving tea to the crew. Mando is obviously hesitant, but Kuiil
                ensures he’s
                reprogrammed the droid to be a caretaker. IG-11 then becomes the babysitter, and Kuiil brings his
                blurggs as
                well. The
                crew makes the journey to Nevarro, and they meet Karga in a remote area where they can’t be spotted.
                Karga has his own crew with him, which he shoots when he has a change of heart. They were going to kill
                Mando and his
                crew and take the Child to the Client, but after the Child healed Karga’s life-threatening injury, he
                couldn’t do it.
                They devise a plan to enter the city involving the Child’s pram being used as a decoy to make the forces
                in
                the city
                believe they have the Child with them, but in reality, Kuiil would take the Child back to the Crest. The
                plan is set
                into motion, and the crew meets with the Client at the cantina in the city. Karga pretends to still be
                working against
                Mando, but it’s all part of the ploy.
                <br>
                The Client asks to see the Child, but they refuse. A stormtrooper then sets up a holo to connect the
                Client
                to Moff Gideon,
                the one in charge of the vast Imperial forces just outside of the cantina. He asks if the crew brought
                the
                Child, but the
                Client is too vague for Gideon’s liking, so he instructs his troops to fire on the cantina. The Client
                and
                his personal
                cadre of troopers die in this violence, while the rest of the crew hole up. Mando tries to get in touch
                with
                Kuiil to check
                on his and the Child’s progress, but he’s unable to reach Kuiil. That’s because Kuiil was shot by scout
                troopers, and the
                Child is now in their possession.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> As the scout troopers wait outside the city for more instructions regarding what to do next with the
                Child,
                IG-11 comes to the
                rescue by killing the troopers and reclaiming the Child. At the cantina, Mando and the crew are trying
                to
                figure out how to
                escape. They find a sewer hatch, and as they’re trying to break through to it, Moff Gideon reveals a lot
                of
                personal and, up
                until now, unknown information about the crew members: that Cara Dune is a survivor of Alderaan, which
                motivated her to become
                a member of the Rebellion; that the Mandalorian’s name is Din Djarin, a survivor of the Siege of
                Mandalore
                and the Night of a
                Thousand Tears; and he refers to Karga as “Magistrate,” suggesting that if he cooperates that he would
                get a
                promotion.
                Gideon offers to negotiate with them to surrender, but if they won’t, his forces will destroy the
                cantina.
                The crew discusses
                these new revelations, which bring forth new revelations: “Mandalorian” is not a race, it’s a creed; and
                that Din Djarin is a
                foundling, rescued by Mandalorians during a Separatist attack on his planet. Because of Djarin’s
                history, he
                knows about
                Moff Gideon: that he used to be in the ISB during the Great Purge of Mandalore, and that he’s a war
                criminal. Gideon decides
                to send an incinerator trooper into the cantina.
                <br>
                Since Djarin is greatly injured at this point, he decides to stay back and protect their retreat through
                the
                now unsealed
                sewer grate. However, this is unnecessary when the Child uses the Force to hold back the fire from the
                flamethrower, covering
                the group’s escape. Down in the sewers, Mando needs medical attention, but can’t remove his helmet in
                front
                of other people.
                But, IG-11 is now programmed for caretaking and isn’t a person, so Din Djarin allows the droid to apply
                bacta spray to heal him.
                They regroup and head to the Mandalorian covert, but find many Mandalorians dead. The only one remaining
                is
                the Armorer, who
                explains that the Child may be a Jedi due to his abilities. She also tells Djarin that the Jedi were
                enemies
                of Mandalorians,
                but the Child is not an enemy, but Djarin’s foundling. She forges Mando’s signet - the Mudhorn, and
                informs
                him that he’s now
                a clan. Her last parting gift to Din Djarin is a jetpack.
                <br>
                The group leave the Armorer where they found her as stormtroopers rush in. She remains and fights them
                off
                with her forging
                tools. The group takes a lava boat to get to the surface. Waiting for them at the end of the tunnel is a
                massive amount of
                stormtroopers. IG-11 decides to sacrifice himself by activating his self-destruct and wading through the
                lava to the opening
                of the tunnel. The group escapes into the plains of Nevarro, but Moff Gideon is closing in on them in
                his
                TIE fighter.
                Mando uses his jetpack and grappling hook in combination to reach the TIE and plant a detonator on its
                wing
                joint, downing
                the fighter. The group parts ways, and Mando buries Kuiil. He gives the Child his mythosaur necklace,
                and
                the Razor Crest
                takes off from Nevarro. Returning to Gideon’s crash site, a blade of black outlined in white energy
                carves a
                hole out of
                the TIE, allowing Gideon to climb out of the wreck. The blade he used wasn’t just any blade, but the
                infamous Darksaber.
