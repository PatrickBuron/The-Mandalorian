            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Star Wars creator George Lucas had begun developing a live-action Star Wars television series by 2009, but this project was 
                deemed too expensive to produce. He sold Lucasfilm to Disney in October 2012. Subsequently, work on a new Star Wars series 
                began for Disney+. Favreau signed on in March 2018, serving as writer and showrunner.

            <p> He executive produces alongside Dave 
                Filoni, Kathleen Kennedy, and Colin Wilson. The series' title was announced in October 2018, with filming starting at Manhattan 
                Beach Studios in California. Visual effects company Industrial Light & Magic developed the StageCraft technology for the series, 
                using virtual sets and a 360-degree video wall to create the series' environments. This has since been adopted by other film 
                and television productions.

            <p> The first season of The Mandalorian premiered with the launch of Disney+ on November 12, 2019. A second season premiered on 
                October 30, 2020, and a third season premiered on March 1, 2023. A fourth season is in development. Interconnected spin-off 
                series The Book of Boba Fett, Ahsoka, and Skeleton Crew expand on The Mandalorian's timeframe, with an untitled feature film 
                directed by Filoni set to serve as a conclusion to the interconnected stories.
            </p>
                <br>

            <p> The series has received largely positive reviews from critics, with strong praise to the performances (particularly Pascal's), 
                visual effects, cinematography, direction, action sequences, emotional weight, musical score, and the chemistry 
                of the two leads. The first season was nominated for Outstanding Drama Series at the 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards, and won 
                seven Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards.
