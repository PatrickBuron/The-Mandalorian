                <p>
                    Din Djarin and the Child visit an underground fight club to seek information about other
                    Mandalorians
                    from
                    Gor Koresh, but
                    Koresh demands Din's beskar armor in exchange. Din refuses and fights Koresh's thugs, eventually
                    forcing
                    him
                    to give up
                    information on a rumored Mandalorian on Tatooine. Now with a new lead, Din arrives at Tatooine and
                    lands
                    at
                    Peli Motto's
                    hanger once again. She watches the Child while Djarin searches for the other Mandalorian.
                </p>

                <p> He travels to the town of Mos Pelgo where he finds Cobb Vanth, who is wearing Mandalorian armor
                    previously
                    owned by Boba Fett. It is revealed
                    that Vanth bought the armor from Jawas. The two men are about to fight over the armor when suddenly
                    the
                    town
                    starts shaking: a krayt dragon
                    starts to attack Mos Pelgo. They team up to kill a krayt dragon terrorizing them, along with the
                    help of
                    Tusken Raiders. The motley group
                    successfully kills the dragon, and Vanth hands over his Mandalorian armor and jetpack to Din. A
                    scarred
                    man
                    is seen watching from a distance.
                </p>

                <p> Djarin accepts a job from Motto in exchange for a new lead on another Mandalorian covert, which
                    requires
                    him
                    to transport a frog-like creature
                    with a canister of eggs to the next system. They are pursued by two New Republic X-wings, and Djarin
                    crash-lands on a planet to evade them.
                    The Razor Crest sustains heavy damage, and the Child eats some of the eggs while they wait for
                    repairs.
                    Frog
                    Lady communicates through the
                    corpse of the droid Zero, revealing that the eggs are the last brood of her life cycle, and if she
                    doesn't
                    deliver them to her husband, her
                    family line will go extinct.
                    Djarin and the Child follow Frog Lady to a hot spring in a cave, where they encounter a massive
                    amount
                    of
                    spider eggs that begin to hatch.
                    They are chased by the newborn spiders back to the Crest, but are followed closely by the swarm,
                    which
                    causes even more damage to the ship.
                    With the help of the two X-wing pilots, they fend off the spiders and manage to escape. The pilots
                    reveal an
                    arrest warrant on Djarin but
                    let him go due to his heroic actions. The Crest is severely damaged, but just enough repairs are
                    made to
                    make it capable of flight. The
                    three take off into space in search of Frog Lady's husband.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p> The Razor Crest, looking like it's seen better days, lands on the moon Trask. Mando seeks
                    information
                    about
                    finding other Mandalorians,
                    and a Quarren on the dock offers to take him to them. Djarin ends up being betrayed by the Quarren,
                    who
                    traps him and steals his armor,
                    then throws him into the water. The Mandalorian is rescued by three other Mandalorians, who reveal
                    themselves to be Bo-Katan Kryze, Axe Woves,
                    and Koska Reeves. They explain to him that he is part of a cult of religious zealots, the Children
                    of
                    the
                    Watch, who broke away from
                    Mandalorian society. Bo-Katan and her Mandalorians ask Mando to help them hijack an Imperial
                    shipment of
                    weapons on a Gozanti-class cruiser.
                    The group successfully infiltrates the ship, but the Imperial captain tries to crash the ship rather
                    than
                    give up the weapons, kicking off a
                    battle between the Mandalorians and stormtroopers for control of the cruiser. Bo-Katan demands to
                    know
                    the
                    location of the Darksaber from the
                    captain, who bites an electric tooth that instantly kills him. Bo-Katan tells Mando to take the
                    foundling to
                    Corvus to find a Jedi named Ahsoka
                    Tano, and to tell Tano that Bo-Katan sent them. They part ways, and Mando and the Child return to
                    the
                    still
                    dilapidated-looking Razor Crest.
                    Djarin attempts to take off, and the ship starts to fall apart in the process.
                </p>

                <p> Mando and the Child head to Nevarro for help repairing the Razor Crest. Greef Karga, now the
                    Magistrate
                    of
                    Nevarro, and Cara Dune, now the
                    Marshal of Nevarro, meet them and offer to repair the Crest. They ask Mando to help them take out
                    the
                    last
                    Imperial outpost on the planet,
                    both so they can sell the weapons from the outpost on the black market, but also so that Nevarro can
                    be
                    freed of Imperial rule. The Mandalorian
                    agrees and drops the Child off at a local school while on the mission.

                    They infiltrate the outpost and find tanks with mangled bodies, suggesting that the outpost is
                    actually
                    a
                    scientific laboratory. The group
                    finds a holo of Doctor Pershing, seemingly reciting the results of an experiment: that a body
                    rejected a
                    blood transfusion and that they need
                    a donor with a higher M-count (midi-chlorians). He also reveals that they need more of the Child's
                    blood
                    in
                    order to do more experiments.
                    The group fights off stormtroopers and TIE fighters in their escape from the outpost. As they make
                    their
                    way
                    back to town, they are questioned
                    by New Republic pilot Captain Carson Teva, who is investigating the destruction of the outpost.

                    Dune declines Teva's offer to join the New Republic, but he gives her a badge after commiserating
                    with
                    her
                    about Alderaan's fate. Meanwhile,
                    on an Imperial cruiser, an Imperial comms officer is talking with a Mimbanese spy who confirms
                    placing a
                    tracker on the Razor Crest. The
                    officer reports the information to Moff Gideon, who is in a laboratory observing a legion of
                    Darktroopers.
                    Gideon says that he's ready to
                    execute his plan.
                </p>

                <p> Elsewhere, on the planet of Corvus, former Jedi Ahsoka Tano battles guards outside the city of
                    Calodan
                    to
                    try to get an audience with the
                    Magistrate, Morgan Elsbeth. Meanwhile, Din Djarin and the Child arrive on Corvus and seek
                    information
                    about
                    the Jedi from the destitute and
                    morose citizens. Mando meets the Magistrate, who hires him to kill the Jedi causing havoc in her
                    city,
                    and
                    offers him a pure beskar spear in
                    return. Djarin eventually encounters Ahsoka Tano, who is initially hostile but is talked down when
                    he
                    mentions that Bo-Katan Kryze sent him,
                    and she also becomes interested in the Child. Ahsoka Tano discovers that the name of the Child is
                    Grogu
                    and
                    that he was trained in the Jedi
                    Temple on Coruscant. Tano tests Grogu's Force abilities and realizes that he has hidden his
                    abilities to
                    survive.
                </p>

                <p>She decides not to train him due to his strong bond with Din Djarin. Tano and Djarin decide to work
                    together
                    to eliminate the Magistrate and
                    free the prisoners of the Calodan. Tano emerges outside the city gates from the mist, ignites her
                    lightsabers, ready to emancipate the city.
                    Ahsoka insists that Elsbeth gives up the whereabouts of Grand Admiral Thrawn. She defeats the
                    Magistrate,
                    and the city is now free. At the
                    Razor Crest, Mando is prepared to say a final goodbye to Grogu, but Ahsoka denies this and instead
                    instructs
                    the pair to go to Tython and
                    place Grogu on the seeing stone, which would allow Grogu to decide what he wants to do and possibly
                    reach
                    out to other Jedi through the Force.
                </p>

                <p> Din Djarin and Grogu arrive on Tython, where Djarin places Grogu on the seeing stone in hopes that
                    he
                    could
                    contact a Jedi. Suddenly, Boba
                    Fett and Fennec Shand arrive and demand the return of Fett's armor. After a tense standoff, Fett
                    offers
                    to
                    protect Grogu in exchange for the
                    armor. Shand reveals that the bounty on Grogu has increased greatly, so he will need protection. She
                    also
                    shows Mando her mechanical innards,
                    which explains how she survived being shot by Toro Calican on Tatooine. Grogu makes a connection to
                    the
                    Force on the seeing stone. But shortly
                    after, stormtroopers arrive to try to capture him. Mando, Fett, and Shand fight off the troopers in
                    an
                    attempt to give Grogu more time on
                    the seeing stone. A blast coming from above very suddenly destroys the Razor Crest.
                </p>

                <p> Then, dropping down from the sky are Darktroopers that surround Grogu, capturing him. The
                    Darktroopers
                    fly
                    away with him, bringing him up
                    to an Imperial cruiser. Mando, Fett, and Shand follow the Darktroopers to the Imperial cruiser in
                    Fett's
                    Slave I, but Mando calls it off
                    in fear of harming Grogu. They decide that their next step is to travel to Nevarro. There, Mando
                    finds
                    Cara
                    Dune, now a Marshal of the New
                    Republic. He needs her help finding a Migs Mayfeld, who is in a New Republic prison somewhere. He
                    informs
                    Dune that Grogu has been kidnapped.
                    Elsewhere, Moff Gideon intimidates Grogu by showing him the Darksaber. Grogu holds his own, using
                    the
                    Force
                    to attack stormtroopers in his
                    cell. Gideon exits the cell and Grogu is stunned and cuffed by a trooper.
                </p>

                <p> Landing on the Karthon chop fields, Cara Dune claims custody of prisoner Migs Mayfeld. She leads
                    Mayfeld
                    to
                    the Slave I where Mando, Fett,
                    and Shand are waiting for him. The group travels to Morak, where they plan to infiltrate an Imperial
                    mining
                    hub so they can get the coordinates
                    of Gideon's cruiser. In order to sneak in, two members of the group need to commandeer a juggernaut
                    tank,
                    which is hauling rhydonium to the hub.
                    Because of scanners, the two people that go cannot have an Imperial criminal record. So, Mayfeld and
                    Djarin
                    sneak into the juggernaut and steal
                    the uniforms of the operators. Donning the Imperial armor, the pair drive their juggernaut towards
                    the
                    mining hub. Along the way, pirates
                    attempt to steal their cargo, and Djarin successfully fights them off. </p>

            <div class="content">
                <p>Arriving at the hub, Djarin and Mayfeld enter the officer's mess. Mayfeld recognizes an officer named
                    Valin
                    Hess and is hesitant to proceed,
                    but Djarin convinces him to give him the datastick. Djarin logs into the network terminal but Hess
                    demands
                    to know his designation, which
                    Mayfeld saves by claiming that Djarin is his commanding officer. The terminal requires a scan of the
                    user's
                    face, forcing Djarin to remove
                    his helmet despite being in a room full of people. After using the terminal, he is forced to sit
                    with
                    Hess
                    and Mayfeld. After they discuss
                    the morality of the Empire's actions, Mayfeld shoots Hess before engaging in a massive fight with
                    stormtroopers and Imperial officers.
                    They escape the hub with the help of Fett, Shand, and Dune, causing a massive explosion and
                    destruction
                    of
                    the hub. They drop Mayfeld off in
                    the forest, and Dune allows him to walk away instead of returning him to prison. Now that they have
                    the
                    coordinates to Gideon, Djarin sends
                    him a threatening holo, using the same verbiage that Gideon used back on Nevarro when he cornered
                    the
                    original crew in the cantina.
                </p>

                <p> The crew board a Lambda-class shuttle carrying Doctor Pershing. One of the pilots of the shuttle
                    shoots
                    the
                    other pilot, informing Cara Dune
                    that Doctor Pershing is a clone engineer and someone who is incredibly valuable to the Empire,
                    warning
                    her
                    not to do anything she would regret.
                    After some tense moments, Dune shoots the second pilot, and the group boards Slave I with Doctor
                    Pershing in
                    tow. The group's next stop is
                    an unidentified planet where Djarin and Fett enter a diner to speak with Mandalorians Bo-Katan Kryze
                    and
                    Koska Reeves to recruit their help.
                    Kryze and Reeves are skeptical of Fett because of his clone past, and they have tense words. But,
                    Kryze
                    agrees to help them capture Gideon's
                    ship so she can take the Darksaber, which she'd use to take Mandalore back.
                </p>

                <p> The whole crew formulates a plan en route to the cruiser. Upon boarding, Djarin makes his way to the
                    brig in
                    hopes of rescuing Grogu, all
                    while Shand, Kryze, Reeves, and Dune fight off resistance as they head toward the bridge. Djarin
                    finds
                    Grogu, but he's being held captive
                    by Gideon, who is holding the Darksaber over his head. Djarin duels Gideon with the beskar staff. He
                    defeats
                    Gideon and puts him in the
                    shackles that once held Grogu. He brings Grogu, his prisoner, and the Darksaber to the bridge to
                    rejoin
                    the
                    group. Kryze is upset that
                    Djarin has the Darksaber. He offers her the saber, but she declines since she didn't win it in
                    battle.
                    Suddenly, an alarm blares on the
                    ship: the entire legion of Darktroopers are making their way toward the bridge. Another alarm goes
                    off,
                    signaling a ship on the radar:
                    one X-wing.
                </p>

                <p>In the confusion, Gideon takes a blaster and tries to shoot both Kryze and Grogu, but Mando uses his
                    body
                    to
                    block the shots from
                    reaching Grogu. Gideon turns the blaster on himself, but Dune knocks it out of his hands and knocks
                    him
                    unconscious. On the security
                    feed, they see someone in the hallway dressed in black robes, wielding a lightsaber and destroying
                    the
                    Darktroopers. Entering the
                    bridge is Jedi Master Luke Skywalker and his droid R2-D2. Djarin gives Skywalker his approval to let
                    Grogu
                    go with Skywalker. The
                    pair say an emotional goodbye. Skywalker, Grogu, and R2 leave Djarin, Kryze, Reeves, Shand, Dune,
                    and an
                    unconscious Gideon on the bridge.
