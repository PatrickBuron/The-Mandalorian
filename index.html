                <h2>New technology</h2>
                <p>Visual effects studio Industrial Light & Magic, a subsidiary of Lucasfilm, opened a new division in
                    November 2018 called ILM TV,
                    specifically intended for episodic and streaming television. Based in London with support from ILM's
                    San
                    Francisco,Vancouver, and
                    Singapore locations, one of the first projects for the new division was The Mandalorian. While
                    directing The Jungle Book
                    (2016), Favreau had used large screens on set to create interactive lighting so when live-action
                    footage
                    was combined with a
                    digital environment in post-production the effect would be more realistic. He found the process to
                    be
                    effective, but time-consuming.
                    When he began working on The Lion King, Favreau worked wit visual effects vendor Moving Picture
                    Company,
                    technology developer Magnopus,
                    and the game engine software Unity to develop a new virtual camera system that allowed him to film
                    scenes in a virtual reality
                    environment as if he was filming with physical cameras.
